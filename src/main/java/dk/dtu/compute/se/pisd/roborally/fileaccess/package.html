This package implements some fila access functions using JSON. This is
mostly used for loading different game boards from files, which is relevant only
for assignment V4b.

And it implements a utility function for reading resource files,
which is used in the {@link dk.dtu.compute.se.pisd.roborally.dal} packacke
already for reading SQL statements (V4a).
