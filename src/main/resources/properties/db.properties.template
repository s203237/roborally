# This is an example for the contents of the file db.properties, which
# contains all access information to the database including credentials.
#
# Make sure that you never commit the file db.properties with the actual
# credentials to a repository. Before running the software, though, you
# need to provide a file db.properties to the software in the subfolder
# "properties" in the projects resources folder, so that this program
# knows which database to use along with the access credentials.
